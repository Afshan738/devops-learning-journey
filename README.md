# My DevOps & Cloud Native Learning Journey

Welcome to my personal learning repository! This project is a living document of my journey as I master the core concepts of modern DevOps, containerization, and cloud native technologies. My goal is to move beyond theory and gain hands-on, practical experience with the tools used by top-tier tech companies.

Each numbered folder in this repository represents a distinct, runnable project that demonstrates a specific concept or skill.

## Table of Contents

This repository is organized into a series of hands-on projects, each building upon the last.

*   **[01 - Docker Full-Stack App](#01---docker-full-stack-app)**
    *   **Concept:** Containerizing a full-stack MERN application.
    *   **Skills:** `Dockerfile`, `docker-compose`, multi-stage builds, container networking.

*   **[02 - Persistent Data with Volumes](#02---persistent-data-with-volumes)**
    *   **Concept:** Managing stateful data for a database container.
    *   **Skills:** Docker Volumes, connecting services to a database container.

*   **[03 - Kubernetes Basics](#03---kubernetes-basics)** `(Upcoming)`
    *   **Concept:** Orchestrating containers at scale.
    *   **Skills:** `kubectl`, Pods, Deployments, Services.

*   **[04 - CI/CD with GitHub Actions](#04---ci-cd-with-github-actions)** `(Upcoming)`
    *   **Concept:** Automating the build, test, and deployment pipeline.
    *   **Skills:** GitHub Actions workflows, secrets management, automated deployments.


## My Learning Philosophy

My approach to learning these technologies is to:
1.  **Understand the "Why":** Focus on the fundamental principles behind each tool.
2.  **Build Hands-On:** Create small, working projects to solidify my understanding.
3.  **Document and Share:** Use this repository to track my progress and share what I've learned.

## Current Tech Stack

The projects in this repository primarily use the following technologies:

*   **Languages:** JavaScript, Python
*   **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js
*   **Frontend:** React.js (Vite)
*   **Database:** MongoDB
*   **Containerization:** Docker, Docker Compose
*   **Orchestration:** Kubernetes `(Learning)`
*   **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions `(Learning)`
